# **App Name**: Echo Shell

## Core Features:

- Terminal Rendering: Render the terminal output in a monospaced font with support for ANSI color codes.
- Input Handling: Accept and display user input in a text field.
- Command Execution: Execute basic shell commands (e.g., ls, pwd, echo) using Node.js runtime without calling external programs.
- Command Autocompletion: Use an AI tool that suggests and autocompletes commands based on the user's input and the previously executed commands.
- Command History: Display a command history, allowing the user to scroll through and re-execute previous commands.
- Customization: Allow customization of the terminal's appearance (colors, font size) via a settings menu.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep indigo (#3F51B5) to evoke a sense of calm and focus, yet still modern.
- Background color: Very dark blue-gray (#263238), almost black, for a distraction-free coding environment.
- Accent color: Electric purple (#7C4DFF), brighter and higher saturation to draw attention to key elements like the prompt or active command.
- Font: 'Source Code Pro', monospace, to ensure every character occupies the same amount of space, for enhanced readability. This will be used for all text within the terminal emulator.
- Simple, geometric icons for settings and other UI controls.
- Clean, minimal layout with clear separation between the input area and the terminal output.
- Subtle fade-in/out animations for new commands and output to avoid distracting the user.
